Apology Letter For Saying Bad Words
Dear Mazu,

I would like to offer my humble apologies for using inappropriate language during {activity/event}. It was rude and disrespectful and I should have known better than to speak like that, especially when coding.
I've learned from my mistake and I promise that this will not happen again. I will be more careful with my choice of words from here on out.

Sincerely,

Jeffery
